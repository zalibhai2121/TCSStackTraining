        Welcome to Foundations of Marketing.  I am Patt Chowdhury, your professor for this class.<br>

        The overall goal of this course is to provide you with a working knowledge of fundamental marketing concepts so you are able to intelligently and confidently discuss them in a professional setting. This course will also prepare you for the core course, Value-Based Marketing.<br/> <br>

        This is a six-week course. Class begins on Tuesday, January 19th, and concludes on Tuesday, February 23rd. This is a Synchronous Online class, which means "same time/same place" just as though you were in the classroom, but the Zoom conference will be your classroom. We begin class at 6:30 pm sharp, so I will open the classroom at 6:15 pm. Please be prepared to use your camera and computer audio for a more realistic experience.  I will send the Zoom credentials the day before the first class via your UD email address. Going forward, you must enter our online Brightspace classroom to find the login credentials.<br/>
